    <p class='
1.'>we hear / talk about distributed &#39;everything&#39;;<br/>
4. During the last few years it became apparent that a broad family of new technologies is emerging with a high potential to disrupt the foundations of the Internet ecosystem as we know it with far reaching repercussions to social, economic, legal, and governmental systems.<br/>
4.1. On the one hand: each emerging technology is very specific about what it does; <br/>
4.2. On the other hand: they are clearly based on the more general concept of &quot;distributedness&quot; in various forms.<br/>
4.3. Also, because they belong to the IT field, from the technical perspective, they are based on the paradigm of &#39;distributed systems / distributed computing&#39;;<br/> 
5.1. I think that this pragmatic technical / computational perspective is very informative to the general understanding of distributed phenomena.<br/>
5.2. Therefore, I would like to explain this perspective under the name of <strong>decentralized IT governance</strong> and discuss how it contributes to understanding the &quot;distributedness&quot; of everything (special interest is the &#39;distributedness of intelligence&#39;).</p>

    <p>a. The short and simple description of &#39;distributedness&#39; is &quot;having no single point of control&quot; / &quot;no single party which establishes trust among participants&quot;;<br/>
b. There is a huge number of new developing technologies which are going disrupt the Internet (by replacing server-client architectures - the backbone of the current Internet);<br/>
c. paves a way for Internet of Things - an ecosystem of billions of interacting devices without central control;<br/>
d. I will shortly present this technology space - just to convey the flavour of what is going on there..</p>

    <p>a. it is interesting how are they going to deliver the detergent to the machine;<br/>
b. one thing to note is that usually every solution / product combines a number of protocols / technical solutions; there is no single protocol - there is an ecosystem or protocols, which are easy to integrate.<br/></p>

  <h3>E.g. #3 Smart Power Grid ecosystem</h3>
  <p><img src="pictures/smart_grid_tomorrow.png" alt=""></p>

  <aside class='notes'>
    <p>a. but the same technologies can be imagined in the ecosystem of smart grid, where devices will autonomously trade energy between each other;<br/>
b. which is a very interesting case to think about, because power grid is a very centralized system for a reason - we do not know how to have a stable system (prevent blackouts) without centralized control of the network;<br/>
c. so while we talk about everything distributed, very often we switch to &#39;centralized&#39; thinking and acting when we need to make things &#39;work&#39;. </p>

  <h2>Centralized \(\leftrightarrow\) decentralized</h2>
  <h3>topology</h3>

<p><img src="pictures/synchronization.png" alt=""></p>

  <aside class='notes'>
    <p>a. Decentralized IT governance is dealing with the balance between distributed / centralized rather than thinking &#39;decentralized&#39;<br>
a. there are no more &quot;purely&quot; centralized systems, as there are no &quot;purely&quot; peer-to-peer where every node is equal;<br/>
b. it is useful to see where different types of systems are in the continuum of centralized decentralized;  <br/>
c. it seems that it is most illustrative to see these systems as network structures;</p>

  <h2>Distributed system</h2>
  <p><img src="pictures/distributed-system.png" alt=""></p>

  <aside class='notes'>
    <p>a. the most interesting case (topology is similar to peer-to-peer, decentralized), where the network is governed by certain &#39;algorithm&#39;, which is centrally defined, but is difficult to picture in a topology (e.g. Bitcoin).<br/>
b. The nesting in the big graph illustrates how you can move from one topology to another, and I think this movement between topologies in the real system is a key to &#39;distributed IT governance&#39;;</p>

  <h2>&quot;Global&quot; perspective</h2>
  <p><img src="pictures/a_god_perspective.png" alt=""></p>

  <aside class='notes'>
    <p>a. a centralized system is where designers take a &#39;global&#39; perspective to the system;</p>

  </aside>

<section class='' data-state='' id='slide-14'>
  <h2>&quot;Local&quot; perspective</h2>
  <p><img src="pictures/a_node_perspective.png" alt=""></p>

  <aside class='notes'>
    <p>a. in the systems with which we are dealing, we (observers, designers, analysers, viewers) are a part of the system;<br/>
b. distributed / decentralized systems are the ones where we take a &#39;local&#39; perspective of a &#39;node in the network&#39;  </p>

  <h1>Distributed and decentralized systems / computing</h1>
  
</section>
<section class='' data-state='' id='slide-16'>
  <h2>A distributed system:</h2>
  <ul>
<li class='fragment'>is made up of a <span class="strong">collection of processes</span> \(V\) (computing units);</li>
<li class='fragment'>operating in a common <span class="strong">communication medium</span> by sending and receiving messages/information through <span class="strong">communication channels</span> \(E\); </li>
<li class='fragment'>in terms of structural view it can be represented as a <span class="strong">connected graph/network</span> \(N = \left\{ {V,E} \right\}\)</li>
</ul>

  <aside class='notes'>
    <p>a. It is a usual assumption when thinking about distributed systems;<br/>
    * that processes cooperate on common (global) goal;<br/>
    * the set of processes is (more or less) static;<br/>
    * communication channels are reliable;<br/>
b. In real systems these assumptions are not very realistic;
c. There is a long standing field of agent based modelling which deals with the these systems;</p>

  <h2>Three graph types / structures of particular interest</h2>
  <p><img src="pictures/graph_types.png" alt=""></p>

  <aside class='notes'>
    <p>a. a ring represents a cycle within the sustem;<br/>
b. a tree represents a program;<br/>
c. clicque represents closely related (similar) components;</p>

  </aside>
</section>
<section class='' data-state='' id='slide-18'>
  
  <p><img src="pictures/graph_with_substructures.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Finding these structures in a larger graph often provides a solution to a problem </p>

  <aside class='notes'>
    <p>a. The structures can be found in existing connections within the graph;<br/>
b. Or &#39;created&#39; by mutating the graph (adding or deleting links)</p>

  <h2>Autonomy of individual processes</h2>
  <ul>
<li class='fragment'>Every process in a distributed system is <span class="strong">completely autonomous sub-system</span> except for messages sent and received;</li>
<li class='fragment'>When solving a problem, a process is characterized by:

<ul>
<li class='fragment'>input parameters (program);</li>
<li class='fragment'>knowledge of the environment (neighbour processes);</li>
<li class='fragment'>information in the internal memory;</li>
<li class='fragment'>information in sent and received messages;</li>
</ul></li>
<li class='fragment'><span class="strong">Every process has its own computation capacities</span></li>
</ul>

  <aside class='notes'>
    <p>a. what is most important in distributed /decentralized system is that each process is a separate computer;<br/>
b. actually, knowledge of the environment is also a kind of information in the internal memory, but there could be more; </p>

  </aside>
</section>
<section class='' data-state='' id='slide-20'>
  <h2>Distributed algorithms</h2>
  <ul>
<li class='fragment'>A <span class="strong">distributed algorithm</span> is a collection of \(n\) automata, each of which is a Turing machine <span class="strong">plus</span> the capability of sending and receiving messages to other processes;</li>
<li class='fragment'>Two types of coordination:

<ul>
<li class='fragment'>The execution of a <span class="strong">distributed synchronous algorithm</span> is governed by the global clock -- the order/causality is the same for all processes;</li>
<li class='fragment'>In <span class="strong">asynchronous system</span> there is no notion of external/global time, therefore each process may see different order of events;</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

  <aside class='notes'>
    <p>a. in order to find / build the structures we have to run distributed programs / algorithms;<br/>
b. important: these &#39;n automata&#39; are the autonomous agents; the global effect of distributed algorithm on the whole system is determined by both the individual processes and the information flowing between them;<br/>
c. usually most of the systems we build are synchronous, because in asynchronous system it very difficult to predict / control what the system will do;<br/>
d. but the world is an asynchronous system...</p>

  <h1>(Distributed) offer network</h1>
  
  <aside class='notes'>
    <p>a. lets see how we can apply above to define the &#39;distributed&#39; offer network<br/>
b. offer network is an architecture for a future economic system that is not centered on the accumulation of money, but on the direct matching of offers and demands (Goertzel, 2015)<br/>
c. I am mostly interested (in this seminar) in a technical manner these offers and demands are matched than the underlying philosophy of offer network. </p>

  <h3>pairs</h3>
  <p><img src="pictures/process_explained.png" alt=""></p>

  <aside class='notes'>
    <p>a. we start by defining simple elements<br/>
b. offer end demand could be the same entity (dataItem) depending on its connectivity;<br/>
c. &quot;process&quot; is a link between two (data)Items which;<br/>
d. if we define similarity measure of dataItems, then we can calculate if they are similar / equivalent.</p>

  <aside class='notes'>
    <p>a. how can we relate the processes?<br/>
b. via finding / calculating similarities among &#39;dataItems&#39;</p>

</section>
<section class='' data-state='' id='slide-25'>
  <h3>Finding chains of processes</h3>
  <p><img src="pictures/offer_network_loops.png" alt=""></p>

  <aside class='notes'>
    <p>a. We get a connected network<br/>
b. Introduced agents - owners of processes, which also own computational resources needed to run distributed algorithms;<br/>
c. What we want to do in an offer network is to connect processes/reactions into chains / loops;<br/>
d. We can define a problem of &#39;solving an offer network&#39;: finding similarities between items and connect chains which have the highest similarity measure;</p>

  <h3>Reminds of work-flow ?</h3>
  <p><img src="pictures/workflow_francis.png" alt=""></p>

    <p>a. The task of finding offer/demand pairs is equivalent to the one of finding a work-flow (coordination) among independent activities within the same medium.</p>

    <p>a. a &#39;centralized&#39; (and somewhat natural) approach for solving the problem would be to &#39;get all items in the network and calculate their similarity matrix, etc.;<br/>

  <h1>Concluding (?) remarks</h1>
  
</section>
<section class='' data-state='' id='slide-32'>
  <h2>Locality / topology is important</h2>
  <ul>
<li class='fragment'>Cycles found in the graph will have to be executed, i.e. goods physically exchanged;</li>
<li class='fragment'>Precise locations / &quot;ownerships&quot; of \(\{\textit{offer},\textit{demand}\}\) pairs will be needed;</li>
<li class='fragment'>Agents may need to confirm transactions and change soft constraints:

<ul>
<li class='fragment'>E.g. <span class="strong">would you like to take a pear instead of an apple?</span> </li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

</section>
<section class='' data-state='' id='slide-33'>
  <h2>Trade-off between knowledge and connectivity</h2>
  <ul>
<li class='fragment'>Due to accelerating change, the environment of each agent in a network (offer network, Internet, society, organization, team, etc.) is in constant flux;</li>
<li class='fragment'>Knowledge of the environment, needed for action, is getting obsolete fast;</li>
<li class='fragment'>It makes more sense to learn how to perform an action every time it is needed rather than keeping memories / experience of previous ones (<span class="strong">E.g. navigation with Google maps</span>);</li>
</ul>

</section>
<section class='' data-state='' id='slide-34'>
  <h2>Continuous participatory sense-making</h2>
  <ul>
<li class='fragment'>Sense-making is an essential aspect of cognition:

<ul>
<li class='fragment'>a continuous effort to form a network of connections and representations of objects as they are perceived in the world;</li>
<li class='fragment'><span class="strong">&quot; [..] is a motivated, continuous effort to understand connections (which can be among people, places, and events) in order to anticipate their trajectories and act effectively in relation to them.&quot;</strong><br></li>
</ul></li>
<li class='fragment'>In participatory sense-making most of the representations of environment come from connections rather than are generated internally from personal experience;</li>
<li class='fragment'>Forgetting past experiences and models of behaviour and fast &#39;on-the-fly&#39; learning becomes increasingly important;</li>
<li class='fragment'><span class="strong">Global Brain is/can be a fluid collective memory for participatory sense-making.</span></li>
</ul>

  <aside class='notes'>
    <p>a. leads to the notion of participatory sense-making<br/>
<strong>go through the bullet points</strong>:<br/> 
b. and an insight important for understanding fluidity of social systems at all levels<br/> 
c. Agents in the society are increasingly consulting their connections every time they have to perform action rather than relying on their &#39;previously acquired&#39; habits;<br/>
d. The information received from these connections is be different all the time and is &#39;up to date&#39;;</p>

  <aside class='notes'>
    <p>a. why we need distributedness<br/>
